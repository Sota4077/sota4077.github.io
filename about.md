I began my career in 2008 in the recycling industry, where I specialized in designing grinding equipment. This experience gave me a solid foundation in industrial design and sustainability. In 2016, I transitioned to the renewable energy sector, focusing on the design of solar farms—projects that directly contribute to a more sustainable future. By 2018, I expanded my expertise into estimating and procurement, areas that are critical to the successful execution of renewable energy projects.

With over a decade in the Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) side of renewable energy, I have cultivated a deep understanding of the complexities involved in bringing large-scale solar projects to life. As an estimator, I take pride in offering accurate, efficient, and innovative solutions, and I’m passionate about sharing the knowledge I’ve gained to help others in the industry succeed.

Beyond my professional work, I have a love for writing. Instead of sharing my thoughts on platforms where they might be lost in the crowd, I created this website to provide valuable insights and perspectives on the renewable energy industry. My goal is to foster a space where ideas can flourish, and knowledge can be shared with those who are as passionate about building a sustainable future as I am.
